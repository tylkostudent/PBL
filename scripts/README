# Assembly Instructions

hexgenerator.py is an assembler for this cpu. 
The script takes 3 arguments:

opcode_list.txt are the names of operations and their value
representations.

instruction_list as in file named instruction_list: here we have
separated by space instruction name (same as in opcode_list), and
source_addr1, source_addr2, destination_addr (all in hexadecimal),

last argument of script is path where hex file will be saved (just
enter the name for a file and it will be created in current directory)

There are different opcode types.
0.  Takes no arguments.  RET, RET0, RET1
1.  Takes 1 argument. JMP, IF0JMP, IF1JMP, CAL, CAL0, CAL1
2.  SET, RST, ST,STN  
3.  LD and LDN
4.  NOT
5 ALU.  takes two sources and a destination.

last argument is choice of sources and destination 
0 - 00
1 - 01
2 - 10
3 - 11

Basically it has a dictionary of opcode names to opcode objects.  The
opcode object has the binary value of the opcode, the type, and a list
of arguments.  The program reads the assembly instructions, converts
them based on the type, and then spits out the machine code.

It has several subroutines.

read_opcodes: Reads the list of defined opcodes, and their conversions
to binary. Creates the opcode map.

read_instruction_file: Reads the program we want to compile, creates
an opcode object, and converts it to a hex line.  Returns a list of
hex lines.  Reuses the opcode objects with different arguments. 

decode_choice: Converts one choice from decimal to binary.

decode_choices: is the heart of the assembler.  Based on the choices
selected, it generates a binary line.

create_hex: Reads the opcode arguments and creates the hex file

write_hex_file: Writes out the new program.
